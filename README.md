# 🧠 News Sidekick — Powered by Sparrow Hawk AI 🦅

**Your personal sidekick for all things hot & happening in Tech, AI, Crypto, Web3, Textile Engineering, and even some Fun shenanigans!**
Just like your cool friend who knows *everything*, this web app serves you trending news in a clean, stylish, and categorized format.

## 🌟 What Is This?

News Sidekick is a stylish news dashboard powered by the **[NewsData API](https://newsdata.io/)** (you can also use [GNews.io](https://gnews.io) if you're looking for an alternative!).
It pulls live news headlines based on smart categories and wraps it up in a beautiful, dark-themed UI that's as smart as it is sleek.

No more tab-switching across platforms — let your sidekick fetch it all for you in one dashboard.

## 🧪 Bonus Tips

* You can swap the API endpoint to GNews by replacing the `fetchNews()` URL logic.
* Want more categories? Just copy-paste a `<section>` block and give it a query!
* Style it your way — color palettes are modular per section.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This app depends on free-tier APIs. If it ever shows an error, you either:

* Exceeded the quota (calm down, news addict)
* Misspelled your API key (rookie move)
* Or the API is temporarily down (sigh, servers...)
